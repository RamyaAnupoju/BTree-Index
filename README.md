# BTree-Index


In this project milestone, we are tasked with implementing a B+ Tree Index for insertion and lookup operations. We will follow the C++ implementation and utilize the BTreeNode classes for automatic splitting when necessary during insertion. The Insertion pair in Python is represented as std::pair in C++.
